Project Name: TCSS 360 – Dungeon Game

Iteration: First Iteration (April 21 – April 27, 2025)

Summary:
I and Linda successfully created five key user stories for the dungeon game project, covering core gameplay mechanics such as movement, combat, healing, collecting items, and game-over handling.
We used YouTrack based on tutorial to manage user stories, track time, and organize our Agile sprint. We also set up a GitHub repository to store and track code development.

Deliverables:
- 5 user stories created in YouTrack
- Stories added to and managed on an Agile Board (Scrum)
- First sprint created and stories moved to "In Progress"
- Time tracking started with individual logs in the Timesheet
- UML Diagram
- SRS
- Screenshots provided for YouTrack and GitHub activity


Issues Faced:
- Initially had trouble locating the Estimation field in YouTrack, resolved by editing project settings
- Adding team members required access to the Users admin panel
